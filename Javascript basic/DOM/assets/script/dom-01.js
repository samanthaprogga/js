    Intro to DOM

    DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents.
    It represents the page that programs can change the document structure,
    style, and content. The DOM represents the HTML ndocument as nodes and objects

    JS knows everything regarding HTML and CSS

    DOM -> document object
    BOM -> window object

    BOM (Browser Object Model) is a browser-specific convention referring to all 
    the objects exposed by the web browser. The BOM allows JS to interact with 
    the browser. The 'window' object is created automacally when you open a 
    web page that uses JavaScript
