- Your code must be clean, organized and readable
- Add ;use strict' to all yout 'js' files. ALWAYS
- Use the proper naming convention when creating files, variables, constants,
  objects, arrays and functions
- Don't use 'var'. Use 'let' and 'const' instead
- Use variables instead of hard-coded values
- Don't you dare use 'if (true)' or 'while(true)'
- Don't compare a Boolean to true/false. The value is alreay a Boolean
- Use ===instead of==


- Keep your functions short. One function should do one job
